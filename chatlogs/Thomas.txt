Thomas: I have a server since 5 years ... I know ... sometime grrrrrRRRR

Fri May 14 10:30:56 2021
Thomas: UI is good, most servers have no problems ... and so i DO NOT update every time a new version is there, just when there IS a problem, check with time, where as the problem and then in 3-4 days again

Fri May 14 10:32:11 2021
Thomas: you might have another problem as your using 5.5.0-dev !!!

Fri May 14 10:33:02 2021

Fri May 14 10:40:38 2021
Thomas: normaly I build cross, mean storage lanes in 4 diections, 8 sides = 9 themes, in center that workspace ... here with flight, I could build 6 directions ... system he

Fri May 14 10:41:08 2021
Thomas: I am sure some are not able to do this without creative ...

Fri May 14 10:49:22 2021
Thomas: Hello

Fri May 14 10:58:14 2021
Thomas: tree hunting

Fri May 14 10:58:54 2021

Fri May 14 11:01:00 2021

Fri May 14 11:01:32 2021
Thomas: every store whereever I play is like this, but this is smal version

Fri May 14 11:03:04 2021
Thomas: normal it is separated in like ore, ingot and blocks also

Fri May 14 11:03:55 2021
Thomas: this is another concept as of each room own look, but some fun also

Fri May 14 11:04:16 2021
Thomas: I can do it much better !!!, here every room is normal 3-4 rows ...

Fri May 14 11:04:32 2021

Fri May 14 11:05:36 2021
Thomas: no, the jump[drive can be done later ... it is for liek a space station ... ip on 20 or 25.000 ..., on my one on my server, there ale also 4 logs for smaler ships to log in, out

Fri May 14 11:06:01 2021
Thomas: I haveone on my server, diameter 74 nodes !!!

Fri May 14 11:06:22 2021
Thomas: I think about, taking the Acount Festus1965 here for creative and have fun

Fri May 14 11:08:03 2021
Thomas: if configre well one goiod pc can handle 8-12 clients

Fri May 14 11:08:14 2021
Thomas: only for Festus1965

Fri May 14 11:08:57 2021
Thomas: and did you check activation radius in minetest.conf setting?

Fri May 14 11:09:53 2021
Thomas: one 1 mean that 9 mapblocks around the position are active = mashine running, tree grow ... 2 mean 27 mapblocks. ... raising lag, depending on CPU

Fri May 14 11:10:03 2021
Thomas: ok

Fri May 14 11:11:42 2021
Thomas: depending on strengts CPU server and RAM ... I have only 2 could take 3 with server i7-4770 8 thread, 32 GB RAm and M.2 SSD

Fri May 14 11:12:17 2021
Thomas: so that mean testing for a view days, bigger mean also the free 32 nodes away might gow or the wheat ... 1 is just about 16 nodes around

Fri May 14 11:14:02 2021
Thomas: ment is active_block_range, just check online here with /set active_block_range

Fri May 14 11:14:41 2021
Thomas: most smal server jsut can do 1, some 2 ... I have no problem with 3 also

Fri May 14 11:15:36 2021
Thomas: most you realize it, when in special lag areas like jungle, or activation technic and pipeworks, mean 10 player all in there mashines makes some lag ... and the wider the farm, 16, 32 or bigger, 1 player can make more running

Fri May 14 11:18:33 2021

Thomas: I have the CORSAIR MP500 ... 120 GB

Wed May 19 06:23:19 2021
Thomas: testing read / write just search for : ubuntu test disc speed : will find like ...

Wed May 19 06:23:33 2021
Thomas: one speedtest is even build in ... open discs ... there

Wed May 19 06:24:04 2021
Thomas: the other is : sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/nvme...

Wed May 19 06:25:41 2021
Thomas: my 32GB are mostly used after 6 hours ... therefor I dont like often restarts as cache, etc. is lost ... now after not 1 hour htop show near 9 GB used, other 14 GB cache

Wed May 19 06:26:08 2021
Thomas: just a teerminal test ... but also with the problem cache sensitive ...

Wed May 19 06:27:03 2021
Thomas: yes

Wed May 19 06:27:31 2021
Thomas: but I have now 8 points lost as not running minimum 8 hours ... as your server is there low down, as not 8 points for running longer that 8 months

Wed May 19 06:27:37 2021
Thomas: Asia Thailand

Wed May 19 06:27:48 2021
Thomas: I think easy to find ... see

Wed May 19 06:29:37 2021
Thomas: after restart as I did just 1 hour before, your gain every hour again 1 point, as full hour running, up max 8 Points

Wed May 19 06:29:52 2021
Thomas: each gamer inside with normal name conventioon also 1 point to max of ??? forgot

Wed May 19 06:31:00 2021
Thomas: advantage from last restart = no more warnings mts as abm couldnt finish in the 200ms ... als work wanted ... and as ABM run every full second ... why to limit on 200ms ??? so I change from before 333ms to now 400ms

Wed May 19 06:31:37 2021
Thomas: I also changes a lot of mods that have interval 1, but change 5 ... what is stupid

Wed May 19 06:32:09 2021
Thomas: too much writing, died ...

Wed May 19 06:36:01 2021
Thomas: when there are stacks as a buffering, sure ... even gold chest might have a helping, as after pulling full items out, getting jsut only 99 sets, instead of 99 * single item in tube

Wed May 19 06:36:58 2021
Thomas: another system might be, first load all digged items into a long row of gold / mithil chests ... and when a row ist full, then take them out by fixed injector stack with blinky for the sorting ...

Wed May 19 06:37:59 2021
Thomas: 1st dig, 2nd store, 3. pull full stacks out, to 4th sorting final store and transformation

Wed May 19 06:40:18 2021
Thomas: I am waiting at a spaecial position on my server, there you get them fly and fast and can go that railway there ... straight ... and see if you outside my net, might gat black sveen stop as data not loaded

Wed May 19 06:40:58 2021
Thomas: oh ... might get black ... screen

Wed May 19 06:42:34 2021
Thomas:  ... following the falling lava to find my bones ... and YOU make your things ready ... at me server no hurry

Wed May 19 06:49:59 2021
Thomas: a beside your upgrade to GB ... don't think we both might have then that speed ... I have 960 in Thailand, to India, Laos, Malaysia Songapore and Taiwan ... everything further ... via ocean network and less availiable place ... is MUCH lower

Wed May 19 06:59:46 2021
Thomas: at your serfer I have 212ms

Wed May 19 07:00:06 2021
Thomas: but about 200 is normal, around DIX Frankfurt where I most get out

Wed May 19 07:00:28 2021
Thomas: with 960 here I testet successfull near 50

Wed May 19 07:01:54 2021
Thomas: but my advantage is that often 10 kids are playing local here, in my pc room or at the restaurant, during parents talk

Wed May 19 07:03:32 2021
Thomas: yes, for the friends from my daughter, school ... and fishing, as fathers often fish here for 8-10 hours, so the kids, most girls can come in and have fun

Wed May 19 07:04:04 2021
Thomas: mean we also have a fishing park ...

Wed May 19 07:05:40 2021
Thomas: not my thing ... wouldmore like to swim there or windsurf ... hihi

Wed May 19 07:06:03 2021
Thomas: but so my partner here, can make the income we need to live and send daughter on private school

Wed May 19 07:06:55 2021
Thomas: and as we own the area, no rening ... makes life easy, even she lsot job as tourguid as of corona last year march

Wed May 19 07:07:19 2021
Thomas: rent payment

Wed May 19 07:08:41 2021
Thomas: yeah I left german army, and germany in 2006 ... no payments ... just used my safings and started here, not working anymore = relaxing

Wed May 19 07:09:37 2021
Thomas: I said better nice live between 50-60 years, than have money with 60 but no brain or body to have fun

Wed May 19 07:11:20 2021
Thomas: msg Moloch careful with BaoBao ... griefer, blockes on 2 or 3 servers

Wed May 19 07:11:27 2021
Thomas: German yes

Wed May 19 07:14:01 2021
Thomas: Thailand, as my server is names also ... BaoBab ... hmm what was on Asia Thailand and even PAndorabox ?

Wed May 19 07:15:35 2021
Thomas: Lanna, North ... just 10 km south of Chiang Mai

Wed May 19 07:16:18 2021
Thomas: BaoBao never saw my proof in YouTube about gamer with this name ? hihi

Wed May 19 07:16:55 2021
Thomas: in my server, at some closed cellar I have honeypots ... and he trapped in 2 times

Wed May 19 07:17:31 2021
Thomas: this is most time I have open ready Vokosvreen app to make move = best proof 

Wed May 19 07:18:09 2021
Thomas: a honeypot (mod by hectic, the old owner of my server) looks like a bones, but when you dig them ... transfer to jail

Wed May 19 07:18:24 2021
Thomas: yes, he uses bud dig

Wed May 19 07:18:44 2021
Thomas: and under all my kids houses I prepared a room like this, no entrance ... with a honeypot

Wed May 19 07:19:42 2021
Thomas: but since I use a server password ... guys like this one got VERY rare ... they even cant find that in the description

Wed May 19 07:21:00 2021
Thomas: just go banned.minetest.one ... IP Block, why banned ...

Wed May 19 07:21:50 2021
Thomas: with iplocation.net and 3 part of IP.1 can locate everyone

Wed May 19 07:22:30 2021
Thomas: I was IT Security Teacher, Programmer, Office, Databasmanager ...

Wed May 19 07:23:14 2021
Thomas: you can't ... as you cant proofe that your this one ... haha

Wed May 19 07:23:57 2021
Thomas: with your full address and name, birthdate as have to be in europe !!! give me your data

Wed May 19 07:24:18 2021
Thomas: I will not delete anything ...

Wed May 19 07:24:35 2021
Thomas: you see how they react when got cought in action !

Wed May 19 07:24:51 2021
Thomas: check his IP at your server login

Wed May 19 07:25:08 2021
Thomas: then we see if we talk about the same one

Wed May 19 07:26:30 2021
Thomas: BaoBab is not a protected / brand name ... and the IP is shortened to 3 diggits ... you have no change

Wed May 19 07:27:53 2021
Thomas: with my EUban name change also dien't work ... as EUban use only 1st 3 diggit of IP = Block ... he is banned even with baobao or baebae

Wed May 19 07:28:43 2021
Thomas: as typical isp users keep always in the ip blocks the isp is using for there area

Wed May 19 07:30:10 2021
Thomas: so now the daylight is back in my shaft ... but still didn't find the bones, as of the lave came in , as of two digged all through without the security blocks to avoid this

Wed May 19 07:40:03 2021
Thomas: JUST i got my bones

Wed May 19 07:40:51 2021
Thomas: there was 3 lava intrudion as of his too fast and not thinking digging

Wed May 19 07:47:53 2021
Thomas: you need to go faaaaaar away from the spawn, no travelnet connection and build your houes and garage there = no more griefer ...

Wed May 19 07:48:46 2021
Thomas: minetest is a griefer and buguser game ... underatnd that and hide your base far away

Wed May 19 07:49:18 2021
Thomas: obsidian is good on other servers, but not here with this very stron pickaxe ...

Wed May 19 07:50:21 2021
Thomas: another trick is, build a house what is overfloated by lava (hidden) between two walls ... then they might have a problem, and take that node that is strongest can find as obsidian, granit, upp

Wed May 19 07:54:09 2021
Thomas: Moloch : can this mod protector block also handle a hurt command when stranger are digging there ? at my used protection blocks, stranger get hurt with -15 when thay dig at others ... so they die before the get through

Wed May 19 07:55:01 2021
Thomas: when I see this, I realy have and will rebuild my base ... as of not optimized for Mapblocks (postool result) and of never ending griefers

Wed May 19 07:56:08 2021
Thomas: wow Celine plane is still in the open hangar ...

Wed May 19 07:57:56 2021

Thomas: if your ip same, still no ping nor mtr

Wed May 19 11:36:12 2021
Thomas: is there any oyther service might answer ?

Wed May 19 11:36:58 2021
Thomas: just relax and make it RIGHT !

Thomas: haha

Wed May 19 20:03:56 2021
Thomas: this they do really !!! I have 5 years practice ... you need to protect about 5 nodes outside more

Wed May 19 20:04:09 2021
Thomas: with spawn ?

Wed May 19 20:04:52 2021
Thomas: yes

Wed May 19 20:05:40 2021

Thomas: he items down at the gold chests, not protected ///

Wed May 19 20:12:34 2021
Thomas: we could send them automatic to the storage Festus build

Wed May 19 20:13:42 2021
Thomas: this is closed only for exit ...

Wed May 19 20:14:11 2021
Thomas: not out, but I can go in ... but like ... ohoh

Wed May 19 20:14:58 2021
Thomas: ok, then - your vehicles should be safer now

Wed May 19 20:16:51 2021
Thomas: sniff

Wed May 19 20:18:23 2021
Thomas: look like jsut the last important teleport for the not sorted out items to the normal line ... and here are the tops missing, but that is nothing

Wed May 19 20:19:23 2021
Thomas: as there are 3 new unsorted items in last chest, the older part system still functional ...

Wed May 19 20:21:09 2021
Thomas: how might try bug in, stuck then at inside stroner wall and dies in lava

Wed May 19 20:21:48 2021
Thomas: his is the style of 3 dases on Pandorabox ... as also there ...

Wed May 19 20:41:49 2021
Thomas: your new fiber IP is still not connected, i see

Wed May 19 20:43:10 2021
Thomas: I also could have static fiber, but makes the line direct double expensive ... mhh, with all that corona lost work and income ... ma

Wed May 19 20:43:32 2021
Thomas: bye

Wed May 19 20:44:07 2021
Thomas: I try then to finish the mining elevator down to end

Thu May 20 10:59:32 2021
Thomas: hello together ... so far I see fixed IP fiber still no IP address ...

Thu May 20 11:00:30 2021
Thomas: I finished the Mining shaft with Elevators every 1000 down to the end ... and went further with some mapwide transportation system

Thu May 20 11:01:43 2021
Thomas: ah follow me

Thu May 20 11:02:02 2021
Thomas: the travelnet blue

Thu May 20 11:03:18 2021
Thomas: every travelnetbox hanging here is in a distance of 1000 real nodes, but when jump in, just walk 2 nodes and jump out 1000 nodes away ... like this here everyone could 'walk' to far away areas, to avoid to near building, and to avoid real walking, fast, fl/home/v/Documents/minetest/chatlogs/Thomas.txt

Thu May 20 11:03:57 2021
Thomas: just see, need to reach level 100 fast as all my tools are ... dig sig ... grrr more dig and dig ...

Thu May 20 11:04:19 2021
Thomas: I am at this travelnet word net station, is under 0,0,0

Thu May 20 11:04:55 2021
Thomas: I am working on the travelnets in Discance 5000, and 10000 from center, every 5000 distance then

Thu May 20 11:06:23 2021
Thomas: the last one has a cross connection to other side, rest of level down

Thu May 20 11:06:32 2021
Thomas: will rename it better next ...

Thu May 20 11:06:55 2021
Thomas: take care ashle now ... I have time

Thu May 20 11:18:26 2021
Thomas: lol ... backed_clay

Thu May 20 11:18:48 2021
Thomas: build what, is this the JD usage ... thought should be upper 100 or something ?

Thu May 20 11:20:50 2021
Thomas: afk, need to take a shower ... near 32 dC here in room ... lol ... I would start with the JD itself, that see where an what connection nneded and realize the size room it can take with then

Thu May 20 11:22:25 2021
Thomas: my 4 Post USB3.0 card arived today , with horizontal plugs, I need to plug in this super think modbus-to-USB converter for reading my measurements temp, watts around the house ... took some time to rebuild, now I have still 2 plugs free there and even the /home/v/Documents/minetest/chatlogs/Thomas.txt

Thu May 20 11:32:19 2021
Thomas: back; not controll yet - first I did 3 modbus thermomether to see outside, fronbt room (server/PC) and inside room (I am sitting) to know when close the fan/door in morning as outside more warn, and when open it eveniong when outside cold for cooling

Thu May 20 11:33:51 2021
Thomas: as I have 2 solar Griedtied Inverter I wanted to see then also what they both deliver in about 10 sec compare to the usage from haus1 (main restaurant and me with PC) to know, when I cen turn on the aircon manual, as solar is 500 Watt over usage house1 .../home/v/Documents/minetest/chatlogs/Thomas.txt

Thu May 20 11:34:31 2021
Thomas: so temp:L about 7:30 closing doors, can reopen evening 21:30 this time ...

Thu May 20 11:35:37 2021
Thomas: so Watt: as sunny clear sky I get sum near 3.500 watt from solar, the basic usage restaurant and us is about 2k, so when solar is min 500 watt over, I turn my aircon on ... or off, when to less from solar as cloud

Thu May 20 11:36:28 2021
Thomas: Watt: the mtserver with router, switch is 110 watt, my rig then lifts up this room to 250 Watt, and when also CEline is playing, online School, whatever, we have jsut 500 Watt steady here

Thu May 20 11:38:17 2021
Thomas: just 420 watt now here ... this to learn, avoid loosing energy from solar not used / and not able to sell out, but keep solar usage near 100%, and can start calculate how much more solar I need plus a batterie storage system then later to store energy for /home/v/Documents/minetest/chatlogs/Thomas.txt

Thu May 20 11:39:05 2021
Thomas: when I only count the private usage of energy with also kitchen, speed, living we are just over 100% solar, when I take the restaurant in we reach in summer 45% in Winter near 60%

Thu May 20 11:39:43 2021
Thomas: funny today, since about 15:15 couldy but still get 400 Watt out, I use just now 420 Watt ... perfect haha

Thu May 20 11:40:25 2021
Thomas: a month I produce between 560 to 610 KW/h ...

Thu May 20 11:41:17 2021
Thomas: this investment, very easy onGrid, laying on roof, is payed back with saving via cheaper electric bill in under 3 years

Thu May 20 11:41:53 2021
Thomas: 2 time 2K Inverter with each 7* 2*1 meter ... 330 Watt module

Thu May 20 11:42:45 2021
Thomas: sso 28qm covered up there, ... I have 100qm available ... haha, calculated I need then about 4-5 of this solar size to geet autarce, when using batteries

Thu May 20 11:43:36 2021
Thomas: as they are only 12% flat the greater concern is leaves after storm, clean them with a wet househould mob every 7-10 days is enough, depending on smog time or nice air

Thu May 20 11:44:05 2021
Thomas: but the losses are very low from dust ... leaves are a problem

Thu May 20 11:44:17 2021
Thomas: birdshit also ... haha

Thu May 20 11:45:54 2021
Thomas: they most cheap and fast return of investment are onGrid Inverter, making just 100% of the energy a household is using between 11-13 ... measure this 2 months, and if like minimum !!! is always 1KW, then a 1KW Inverter is perfect, no losses, nothing to sel/home/v/Documents/minetest/chatlogs/Thomas.txt

Thu May 20 11:59:00 2021
Thomas: afk - dinner

Thu May 20 12:06:49 2021
Thomas: back ... again mining, to get my oickaxe promoted hihi

Thu May 20 12:10:47 2021
Thomas: ah tool not leveld yet, still 11

Thu May 20 12:11:33 2021
Thomas: titanium

Thu May 20 12:12:59 2021
Thomas: oh, interesting: when gravel or sand falls down to the 'nothing' it stops falling, but blocked = not able to dig anymore

Thu May 20 12:13:43 2021
Thomas: some here

Thu May 20 12:14:39 2021
Thomas: some and try yourself, maybe as admin, but I guess it is more like a bug

Thu May 20 12:16:04 2021
Thomas: gravel, silversand, snad ...

Thu May 20 12:16:14 2021
Thomas: maybe it is solved after a restart

Thu May 20 12:16:30 2021
Thomas: don't do that, but I will see then later if ...

Thu May 20 12:16:52 2021
Thomas: fun ha ?

Thu May 20 12:18:09 2021
Thomas: just let it for now ... see what is after restart, and then can think about what problems it might couse some day ...

Thu May 20 12:18:31 2021
Thomas: at my one I can even put things on that floor here, here it doesn't work ...

Thu May 20 12:19:25 2021
