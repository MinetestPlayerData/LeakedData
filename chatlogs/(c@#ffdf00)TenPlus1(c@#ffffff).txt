(c@#ffdf00)TenPlus1(c@#ffffff): Mob Protection Rune level 1 only protects against being hit by anothe rplayer when inside a protected area

Wed Apr 21 21:23:39 2021
(c@#ffdf00)TenPlus1(c@#ffffff): level 2 protects against being hit, being shot and fire

(c@#ffdf00)TenPlus1(c@#ffffff): which is why it's more expensive :d

Wed Apr 21 21:24:26 2021
(c@#ffdf00)TenPlus1(c@#ffffff): it still has to be inside a protected area to work
