Festus1965: I am research now ... please ... let me check same problem on owqn server, as ther eI have 1/x loaded ... to understand why and what

Mon May 17 11:02:07 2021
Festus1965: I did once a easy server less mods and no password ... got fast full, but You really woun't see the area around the spawm ... like after nuclear war

Mon May 17 11:02:45 2021
Festus1965: so I don't WANT this most crazy phone gamer join there - mean I have password to enter server = dump people are loked out

Mon May 17 11:03:41 2021
Festus1965: Moloch: I spread 3 Anchor on my world, and one of them I got 1/1 map block force loaded ... now I search what and why this one, what node is there activation

Mon May 17 11:05:02 2021
Festus1965: the larger you do the radius, the more likely you include a node that is what we search for = configured node, and when I grow is slow, each 2 nodes plus, I hopes to find some ... as happened now at my server, but still not sure what node it is

Mon May 17 11:05:54 2021
Festus1965: tNO that is not 512 Radius, 32 rasius is 32 radius, but as one mapblock is 16 wide, set 32 is 64 diameter, and so mind 4-5 mapblocks, and 5*5*5 = ???

Mon May 17 11:07:05 2021
Festus1965: so with 512 it tries to activate 512 MApblocks or it is (8*8) 64 * 64 * 64 nodes square

Mon May 17 11:08:10 2021
Festus1965: oh we have electric down I have ... mo would have to leave, and 3. time now ... later

Mon May 17 11:08:49 2021
Festus1965: 110 is widest / 16 = aboout 5 blocks, 5*16 = 80 diameter ... = 40 to set as radius

Mon May 17 11:08:50 2021
Festus1965: bye

Mon May 17 12:51:04 2021
Festus1965: so back ... at my server the Anchor worked after restart ... set 3 of them ... and after not any worked, then i worked with a switching station, nuclear and player detector nearby, after resatrt as of an upgrade all worked

Mon May 17 12:54:37 2021
Festus1965: I fear thats the solution as nothing else at me made better sense that they run (and activate) or not

Mon May 17 12:55:18 2021
Festus1965: you just set one here ... and after a not early needed shutdown we will know the answer or still be ... sad

Mon May 17 12:57:41 2021
Festus1965: yeah, the power failure took 1 hour, and then I haad to start the server, and all first

Mon May 17 12:58:34 2021
Festus1965: my batteries at server and working PC are for near 15 minutes good ... then I have to control shut down ... before ...

Mon May 17 13:00:04 2021
Festus1965: och, thunderstorm nearby, we cant see ... or truck take down electric plot, ... or sheduled shutdown as 17:10 to 18:10 is wired ... or trouble to less electric ...

Mon May 17 13:01:10 2021
Festus1965: any problems with the storage ?

Mon May 17 13:01:43 2021
Festus1965: but I guess also no load into it from the quasrries ?

Mon May 17 13:02:16 2021
Festus1965: so far also no new unsorted items in last chest

Mon May 17 13:02:41 2021
Festus1965: then I will be silent and see and check ...

Mon May 17 13:06:20 2021
Festus1965: use them ONLY where needed as central work dont run ... rigs ok, as nothing else around ... but that cout ruin the lag

Mon May 17 13:06:36 2021
Festus1965: I see income from 2 so far

Mon May 17 13:06:42 2021
Festus1965: 3 now

Mon May 17 13:21:57 2021
Festus1965: maybe you can look for an mod postool ... that would allow builders to fix a installation like farm or technic into ONE mapblock 16*16 with 2 floors each 8 like I do. more effective using activation radius

Mon May 17 13:23:48 2021
Festus1965: just now I am too lazy to calculate where at -975 is the next border, as /16 and round up + 1

Mon May 17 13:25:55 2021
Festus1965: when using this tool just with start of an build, you can do the walls at the borderline, keeping 14*14*14 nodes protected sure inside ONE Block, so with your setting activation 4 a building with 9*9*9 mapblocks, where the gamer base is center, you know th/home/v/Documents/minetest/chatlogs/Festus1965.txt

Mon May 17 13:27:04 2021
Festus1965: most I do 1 or 2 floors up the earth ... and the top level is farming ... knowing at home all is running

Mon May 17 13:28:22 2021
Festus1965: at the storage I put this wall used light nodes on the tubes at the position where the nodes are filling up the chest = easier to control what is getting ful and need more chest or a new solution as crafting, transforming or trash

Mon May 17 14:33:32 2021
Festus1965: hi, from my position i see 2 levels both tubelines, and gravel out ... and as long items pass me = all ok

Mon May 17 14:34:35 2021
Festus1965: loaded and working yes

Mon May 17 14:35:19 2021
Festus1965: but I am inactive ... reading news

Mon May 17 14:49:24 2021
Festus1965: good night then, seam stable here ...

Tue May 18 04:01:02 2021
Festus1965: how you took all items so eeasy ?

Tue May 18 04:07:22 2021
Festus1965: beside cobblestone, I take out eary now also iron, copper, gold and silver ... let them jump direct to 2nd floor

Tue May 18 04:13:28 2021
Festus1965: just beack from bird feeding

Tue May 18 04:14:28 2021
Festus1965: minimum 5 days

Tue May 18 04:15:24 2021
Festus1965: et catfood, contain fish - as the cats get there food anyway, i just steel from 'them'

Tue May 18 04:15:31 2021
Festus1965: wet catfood ...

Tue May 18 04:19:00 2021
Festus1965: ok, beside ot with the coal filter, i also teake out 4 of the most xtraores and send them direct near the storage

Tue May 18 04:19:42 2021
Festus1965: I will oalso take out gravl and silversand so I see waht is passing often

Tue May 18 04:21:49 2021
Festus1965: as we have a fishing park, rain worm might no the problem ... or maggots from rotten meat, flys did eggs ?

Tue May 18 04:27:45 2021
Festus1965: as you might see, BEFORE the 5 income merge together, different msot send items are taken out (goring down) and take short teleport way

Tue May 18 04:28:19 2021
Festus1965: like the iron lump don't need to travel all the sand and stone area (1st floor) when used in 2nd floor

Tue May 18 04:30:28 2021
Festus1965: HC mashines have no network ?!

Tue May 18 04:30:37 2021
Festus1965: HV

Tue May 18 04:31:09 2021
Festus1965: could be much better, I should use that area there to separate direct all from 2nd floor out ... but ... hmm

Tue May 18 04:31:28 2021
Festus1965: switching Station overloaded ... restaing in x sec

Tue May 18 04:32:11 2021
Festus1965: but how to know when station don't show me usage and supply, grrrr

Tue May 18 04:32:31 2021
Festus1965: or too mach maschines, need to change to nuclear power = 1, instead of 100 hydro

Tue May 18 04:32:59 2021
Festus1965: no, the HV has not so much, and the much mashine MV IS working, so ...

Tue May 18 04:34:37 2021
Festus1965: so enlage to convert 150 K from the 180 K MV to HV

Tue May 18 04:35:13 2021
Festus1965: HV network working, telling using 4000, from 150 k haha

Tue May 18 04:35:38 2021
Festus1965: or 4 k from 135 k ... so there is much enough energy ...

Tue May 18 04:36:43 2021
Festus1965: now I shorten the HC cable, so that the Station is direct betwee supply and using mashines ... works again

Tue May 18 04:37:51 2021
Festus1965: then I will take away soem of the hydro also ... just produce waht is needed + 10%

Tue May 18 04:38:37 2021
Festus1965: could been to much mashines in one sector (mapblock ...)

Tue May 18 04:39:39 2021
Festus1965: so MV make 80 k, convert 50 k

Tue May 18 04:39:52 2021
Festus1965: HC sill 54 k, need 4 k

Tue May 18 04:40:21 2021
Festus1965: NEVER do 2 switching station on ONE net

Tue May 18 04:40:31 2021
Festus1965: hello

Tue May 18 06:02:18 2021
Festus1965: did the lag get better, as I also shortened a lot of tubes, to teleport ... as the baked stones took along way, no all transformed items jump direct to there row = not near 200 nodes tube

Tue May 18 06:25:19 2021
Festus1965: yes, auto ore to ingot, when ingot full, auto to block

Tue May 18 06:25:54 2021
Festus1965: also the MV and HV energy is closer to usage = short cable

Tue May 18 06:27:30 2021
Festus1965: it must be functional ... i guess 1st

Tue May 18 06:28:54 2021
Festus1965: this self chests ... making sure between two mashines the tubes might not get too full

Tue May 18 06:30:01 2021
Festus1965: this self containing chests are good for short storage, and put more single items into stacks ... = less work on tubesystem then

Tue May 18 06:30:39 2021
Festus1965: first check and let this iron and copper solution work (not more goldchests) and then see if work nice under load, and can copy later to gold, silver, ... 

Tue May 18 06:31:50 2021
Festus1965: anyway, there will be always a trash in the row later, when even iropn ingot and blcosk are full

Tue May 18 06:32:38 2021
Festus1965: you need to understand this system ... that you can later manage wourself

Tue May 18 06:32:55 2021
Festus1965: now I got stone dust here !!!

Tue May 18 06:33:13 2021
Festus1965: where is that coming from ?

Tue May 18 06:34:04 2021
Festus1965: down here important last chests ... check, then you know what storage have to be build more, as this items here are not stored yet

Tue May 18 06:35:11 2021
Festus1965: and now I am getting even Iron Ingos in here ... what did you do up there ?

Tue May 18 06:38:43 2021
Festus1965: after I just this iron ingots ariving at the end ... I am not sure now ...

Tue May 18 06:39:51 2021
Festus1965: ok they get here ... no idea why 20 iron ingot of then arives down at last chest !!!

Tue May 18 06:40:38 2021
Festus1965: BUT first I would like to rebuild the filter system, for better performance, mean, take out all other items before the 1st floor, as ore, etc. direct down to 2nd floor

Tue May 18 06:41:09 2021
Festus1965: for this I need all rigs stopped ... but more load, after there was a tube break at the end of 1st floor row = NO

Tue May 18 06:41:30 2021
Festus1965: I NEED to rebuild this part ehre ...

Tue May 18 06:42:18 2021
Festus1965: I have NOW more than 3 hours to work it out, later we are out of house

Tue May 18 06:42:38 2021
Festus1965: so if possible yes, or ... leter, BUT then no moreloads on the system (rig4)

Tue May 18 06:42:49 2021
Festus1965: then take them OFF now please

Tue May 18 06:43:16 2021
Festus1965: I see when all stopped and start then

Tue May 18 07:11:27 2021
Festus1965: ok, when you have time, enable just ONE of the rig ... that I see relaxed if it does what I want

Tue May 18 07:13:03 2021
Festus1965: ok, coming ... i check some time

Tue May 18 07:16:47 2021
Festus1965: ok, there are all rules korrect used, no jam ... You can open next 1 rig

Tue May 18 07:25:45 2021
Festus1965: two things are important here: reduce load (take out very often items to short way), AND take out items don't need to cycle 1st floor often coming

Tue May 18 07:26:48 2021
Festus1965: most items cobble, gravel, silversand, flint, coal .... often items fast for second flor: iron, copper, silver, ...

Tue May 18 07:28:23 2021
Festus1965: but to be honest, I think I have to build it complete new, other area more place, and do a section deparating, mean I can sort out 2 * 6 items and let them jump to the first sorting of thoose ... then very low work, and low tube usage

Tue May 18 07:29:34 2021
Festus1965: so as diamond, mese, iron, copper, silver and tin are the first 6 mineral 2nd fllor I transfer them in at diamonds, and gold, lead ... are sorting position 7-12 take out together and send them in at sorting 7

Tue May 18 07:29:54 2021
Festus1965: CAN do 3rd rig ... should sure work now as rules are same

Tue May 18 07:31:40 2021
Festus1965: I see income at 4 channels now

Tue May 18 07:33:14 2021
Festus1965: 2 mistakes i have seen and fixed ... yes, works

Tue May 18 07:33:40 2021
Festus1965: you need to add the teleport tube there first

Tue May 18 07:33:46 2021
Festus1965: hello

Tue May 18 07:34:14 2021
Festus1965: the next rip channel teletube is not fixed here yyet ... NO recaiver

Tue May 18 07:35:41 2021
Festus1965: there is NO marketstore5 receiver teletube installed

Tue May 18 07:36:37 2021
Festus1965: that is exact what caused the overload and tube break ... merging them BEVORE cobble, gravel, coal are sorted out

Tue May 18 07:37:40 2021
Festus1965: the tube was breaking, AS OF to much items on less tubelines, ... therefore I build this sytem to sort out much items on 5 income first, and then merge the line, as not less inside

Tue May 18 07:39:26 2021
Festus1965: of it braeaks have fun with it ... every income should have a similar amount of quarrys sending in, the one has more than the others might break first

Tue May 18 07:40:33 2021
Festus1965: I call it loadbalancing , but ... hmmm

Tue May 18 07:41:18 2021
Festus1965: at the end we had a breaking tube in morning, very less items now, as thay most take the shortcut

Tue May 18 07:41:54 2021
Festus1965: ok, we let it work a few years and see further ???

Tue May 18 07:42:30 2021
Festus1965: bussy here, wow

Tue May 18 07:43:19 2021
Festus1965: ok, I take a break ...

Tue May 18 07:50:14 2021
Festus1965: Question: at cobblestone sure WE are same decision: what is too much goes to trash (after al chest full witch cobblestone, sone, stoenbrick and stoneblock ... )- yes?

Tue May 18 07:51:06 2021
Festus1965: tso what we do if iron lump is coming in faster then it can work out to iron ingot ... OR what do we do with iron lump, when lump, ingot AND blocks are full ?

Tue May 18 07:54:50 2021
Festus1965: I mean when realy iron bars/ingot AND iron blocks are full ... then still store the lumps ? yes / no - both versions I have idea

Tue May 18 07:55:46 2021
Festus1965: tif no, send to trash ... if yes ... just own we have space ... that hole here towers like you did, but one tower ONE item kind

Tue May 18 07:58:01 2021
Festus1965: mixing after we HAVE the items already sorted ... oh no, please not ... just where I am no ... doing your towers (I use same system on my spaceship) ... pure one item kind ... I just did stat for iron her

Tue May 18 07:59:15 2021
Festus1965: as cobble is deleted, and silversand gets then into stone and brick ... also coal, after coal and coalblocks are full, we just convert (compress via dust to diamonds), there will not be much towers needed so fast ...

Tue May 18 07:59:24 2021
Festus1965: here come to my position

Tue May 18 08:00:18 2021
Festus1965: until this tower is full with iron lumps, oh my good ... or store it as blocks, saving space

Tue May 18 08:00:48 2021
Festus1965: on this configurteation never a pipe breaks ... throughput with ONLY iron lumps is too low

Tue May 18 08:01:47 2021
Festus1965: at your old towers, you send ALL together in ... sure thats another load and dangerous

Tue May 18 08:02:22 2021
Festus1965: I take a break again ... feed the bird

Tue May 18 08:06:28 2021
Festus1965: they are not looking nice ... should take them in some ay ... on strage place and sorted here also

Tue May 18 08:06:43 2021
Festus1965: another question: will you build even more rigs ?

Tue May 18 08:07:27 2021
Festus1965: then IU have to build a completre new sorting system, that can handle the load and also reduce the work on the tubes

Tue May 18 08:08:02 2021
Festus1965: shorten the load, also short the way, items are in tube

Tue May 18 08:09:19 2021
Festus1965: if a uffer, then we do a sorted buffer ... as then if you send out there, a item is mostly 99 pice, and THAT is also reducing the load on the tube, as instead of maybe 99 single stone, there comes then i item including 99 stone

Tue May 18 08:09:56 2021
Festus1965: I mean after such a buffer, we should only send out then full 99 items block ...

Tue May 18 08:10:10 2021
Festus1965: ok ... lets the brain work out a while ...

Tue May 18 08:10:56 2021
Festus1965: as also the presorting BEVOR merking all the income need to be done ... otherwise the tube goes  ... bumm again

Tue May 18 08:12:02 2021
Festus1965: but ... then it is most easy ... just take out any incoming item just at a point and send direct to ther storage ..., easier, faster and no extra injection or impulse to forward them

Tue May 18 08:12:46 2021
Festus1965: this mean, this long lane of each 110 nodes long tuberow through all the floors is not needed anymore also

Tue May 18 08:14:28 2021
Festus1965: I TEST A BIT, HOW IT SHOULD BE BUILD ... GUESSING 1254 RIGS LATER ... .HAHAHA

Tue May 18 08:15:15 2021
Festus1965: or just 26 ?

Tue May 18 08:21:45 2021
Festus1965: think about ... so many rigs, and then eah hase own storage, presort, buffer ???? hmm, just on good system central, then just let the rig dig and send

Tue May 18 09:12:09 2021
Festus1965: Moloch, if still there and short time ... I build a part of a better, faster ... system with firsat take often items out, and then send items via teletube direct to their storage

Tue May 18 09:18:57 2021
Festus1965: this is just better, new faster system, that the one existing now 

Tue May 18 09:19:03 2021
Festus1965: not ready

Tue May 18 09:19:16 2021
Festus1965: less tubes to run for all the items

Tue May 18 09:31:05 2021
Festus1965: I am just emptying another tower, using / testing this new filter

Tue May 18 09:31:57 2021
Festus1965: nice, I have no mistaken setting, or jam ...

Tue May 18 09:48:04 2021
Festus1965: ok, leaving, need to go market shoping for restaurant ... fresh things ... bye

Tue May 18 13:16:19 2021
Festus1965: hello again

Tue May 18 13:16:55 2021
Festus1965: bye

Tue May 18 13:17:21 2021
Festus1965: Moloch: did the quarrys run out ?

Tue May 18 13:29:30 2021
Festus1965: hello

Tue May 18 13:41:08 2021
Festus1965: Moloch changed the travelnet

Tue May 18 13:41:57 2021
Festus1965: I asked him, just exact this ... as logical

Tue May 18 13:42:50 2021
Festus1965: thief is written with e .. if this is ment ,. and seam to fix to you

Tue May 18 13:44:44 2021
Festus1965: what is the bad news ? Moloch did exact what I asked to do, jsut change the TravelNet from old now empty position, into here

Tue May 18 13:45:55 2021
Festus1965: there IS no vad news, HE DID what I was asking for, PERFECT

Tue May 18 13:48:03 2021
Festus1965: hello Molloch ... are the quarrys empty ? run out ? ... I just installed another 6 rows, for found items, sent in

Tue May 18 13:48:24 2021
Festus1965: also copper run well, found last chest full, and a lot of new copper ingot

Tue May 18 13:49:20 2021
Festus1965: oh my good ... that seam to need minimum 4 separate entries in sorting system

Tue May 18 13:50:01 2021
Festus1965: when you go ahead like this your world is empty soon ... no mining at all anymore

Tue May 18 13:50:33 2021
Festus1965: then stop it ... it works ... and think about minimum ssend two to diffenrent entries, or let run alone and spread to 4 entries

Tue May 18 13:52:16 2021
Festus1965: when you just use the new big rig on my new filter and sort system = sure know that is holds on ... I guess

Tue May 18 13:52:35 2021
Festus1965: afk

Tue May 18 13:55:31 2021
Festus1965: should I send Thomas to kill you bigthif ?

Tue May 18 14:02:09 2021
Festus1965: cobble

Tue May 18 14:03:07 2021
Festus1965: tphr Thomas

Tue May 18 14:03:18 2021
Festus1965: oh man ... too tired ...

Tue May 18 14:04:31 2021
Festus1965: maybe ... was out of house 2 times today ... that is too much, 1 time all 3 days is ok ...

Tue May 18 14:05:58 2021
Festus1965: I am just 'sucking' out the last 2 single towers with stuff

Tue May 18 14:09:53 2021
Festus1965: I am Thomas

Tue May 18 14:21:12 2021
Festus1965: no ... just let the ship stand in the space ... no jump needed ... hihihi

Tue May 18 14:24:52 2021
Festus1965: I know about JD and spaceship ... but as I see no sense to jump around space with a ship, I dont need the JD
